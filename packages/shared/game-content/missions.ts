The Silicon Valley mindset is characterized by several key principles:

## 1. Think 10x, Not 10%
Incremental improvements are good, but breakthrough innovation requires thinking 10 times bigger than the status quo.

## 2. Fail Fast, Learn Faster
Failure is not the opposite of successâ€”it's a stepping stone to success. The key is to fail quickly, cheaply, and learn from each failure.

## 3. Focus on Impact at Scale
The most successful startups solve problems for millions or billions of people, not just thousands.

## 4. Embrace the Network Effect
Your network is your net worth. Silicon Valley thrives on connections, mentorship, and collaborative competition.

## 5. Data-Driven Decision Making
Gut instincts are important, but data should drive most of your strategic decisions.`,

        content: `# Lean Startup Methodology

The Lean Startup methodology, developed by Eric Ries, focuses on building businesses and products using validated learning, rapid experimentation, and iterative product releases.

## Core Principles

### 1. Build-Measure-Learn Cycle
- **Build**: Create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to test your hypothesis
- **Measure**: Collect data on how customers interact with your MVP
- **Learn**: Use the data to validate or invalidate your assumptions

### 2. Validated Learning
Learning what customers want is more important than having the "perfect" product. Each experiment should teach you something valuable about your customers and market.

### 3. Innovation Accounting
Traditional metrics don't work for startups. Focus on actionable metrics, cohort analysis, and split testing rather than vanity metrics.

## The Problem-Solution Fit

Before building anything, you need to validate:
1. That the problem exists and is significant
2. That your target customers care about solving it
3. That your solution addresses the core problem
4. That customers are willing to pay for a solution

## Customer Development Process

1. **Customer Discovery**: Understand the problem and customer
2. **Customer Validation**: Validate the solution and business model
3. **Customer Creation**: Scale the validated business model
4. **Company Building**: Transition from startup to established company`,

They would be willing to pay $20/week for pre-planned healthy meals if we provide personalized meal plans with grocery lists because it saves them 2+ hours per week and improves their health."

- How you will test it
- What success metrics you'll measure
- What would cause you to pivot or abandon the hypothesis`,

## What is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is a distributed, immutable ledger that maintains a continuously growing list of records (blocks) linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.

## Core Components

### 1. Blocks
- **Header**: Contains metadata about the block
- **Hash**: Unique identifier for the block
- **Previous Hash**: Links to the previous block
- **Merkle Root**: Summary of all transactions in the block
- **Timestamp**: When the block was created
- **Nonce**: Number used once in proof-of-work

### 2. Transactions
- Digital records of asset transfers
- Signed with private keys
- Verified using public keys
- Grouped into blocks by miners/validators

### 3. Network Nodes
- **Full Nodes**: Store complete blockchain history
- **Light Nodes**: Store block headers only
- **Mining/Validator Nodes**: Create new blocks

## Cryptographic Foundations

### Hash Functions
- One-way mathematical functions
- Input â†’ Fixed-size output (hash/digest)
- Avalanche effect: Small input changes = dramatically different output
- Bitcoin uses SHA-256

### Digital Signatures
- Prove ownership without revealing private keys
- Created using private key + message
- Verified using public key + signature + message
- Ensures authenticity and non-repudiation

### Merkle Trees
- Binary trees of hashed transaction data
- Enable efficient verification of large datasets
- Root hash represents all transactions in a block

## Decentralization Benefits

1. **No Single Point of Failure**: Distributed across many nodes
2. **Censorship Resistance**: No central authority can block transactions
3. **Transparency**: All transactions are publicly verifiable
4. **Immutability**: Historical records cannot be altered
5. **Trustless**: No need to trust intermediaries`,

   - What contract is being called?
   - What function was executed?
   - How much gas was used vs. the gas limit?

2. **Token Transfer**:
   - Find an ERC-20 token transfer transaction
   - What token was transferred and in what amount?
   - Compare the ETH transaction fee to the token value

## Comparison Analysis
Write a 300-word comparison of Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions, covering:

## What are Smart Contracts?

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code. They automatically enforce and execute agreements when predetermined conditions are met, without requiring intermediaries.

## Solidity Language Basics

### Data Types
\`\`\`solidity
// Value Types
bool public isActive = true;
uint256 public balance = 1000;
address public owner = 0x123...;
string public name = "MyContract";

// Reference Types
uint[] public numbers;
mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
struct User {
    string name;
    uint256 age;
}
\`\`\`

### Functions and Modifiers
\`\`\`solidity
// State changing function
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    balances[to] += amount;
}

// View function (doesn't change state)
function getBalance(address account) public view returns (uint256) {
    return balances[account];
}

// Modifier for access control
modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Not the owner");
    _;
}
\`\`\`

### Events and Logging
\`\`\`solidity
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);

function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public {
    // ... transfer logic ...
    emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
}
\`\`\`

## Smart Contract Architecture

### 1. State Variables
Store data on the blockchain permanently

### 2. Functions
- **Public**: Callable by anyone
- **Private**: Only callable within the contract
- **Internal**: Callable within contract and derived contracts
- **External**: Only callable from outside the contract

### 3. Function Modifiers
- **View**: Doesn't modify state
- **Pure**: Doesn't read or modify state
- **Payable**: Can receive Ether

## Gas and Optimization

Every operation costs gas. Optimization strategies:
- Use appropriate data types
- Pack structs efficiently
- Minimize storage operations
- Use events for data that doesn't need to be queryable

## Security Considerations

1. **Reentrancy**: Use checks-effects-interactions pattern
2. **Integer Overflow**: Use SafeMath or Solidity 0.8+
3. **Access Control**: Implement proper permission systems
4. **Input Validation**: Always validate external inputs`,
