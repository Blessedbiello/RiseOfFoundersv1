# 🔧 Vercel Build Fix

## ❌ Error: `npm error Unsupported URL Type "workspace:"`

This error occurs because Vercel uses npm by default, but your project uses pnpm workspace dependencies.

## ✅ Solution Applied

I've fixed this by:

1. **Removed workspace dependency**: Removed `"@rise-of-founders/shared": "workspace:*"` from `packages/frontend/package.json`
2. **Updated Next.js config**: Removed `transpilePackages` reference
3. **Verified no usage**: Confirmed the frontend doesn't actually use the shared package

## 🚀 Deploy to Vercel Now

### Step 1: Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Remove workspace dependency for Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Redeploy on Vercel
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Find your project
3. Click "Redeploy" or push the commit above to trigger auto-deployment

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables
In Vercel dashboard, add these environment variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_NETWORK=devnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_HONEYCOMB_PROJECT_ID=your-honeycomb-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
NODE_ENV=production
```

## ✅ Expected Result

The build should now succeed and you'll see:
```
✓ Collecting page data
✓ Generating static pages
✓ Finalizing page optimization
✓ Build Completed successfully
```

Your frontend will be live at: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`

## 🔍 If You Still Have Issues

1. **Check Vercel Build Logs**: Look for any remaining import errors
2. **Verify Root Directory**: Make sure it's set to `packages/frontend`
3. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure all required vars are set

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Expose Backend**: Use ngrok or deploy to VPS
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3001
   ```

2. **Update API URL**: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to your backend URL

3. **Test Integration**: Connect wallet and test XP system
